.SYNOPSIS
    Syncs shared AI instruction files from IntelliSDLC.ai into this project.

.DESCRIPTION
    Replays the upstream commit history as a sequence of file-system
    operations (add / modify / delete / rename / copy / type-change) against
    the consumer working tree. Conflict-free by construction: rename
    detection runs against the single upstream timeline, and files are
    written byte-for-byte from upstream blobs (no three-way merge).

    Upstream-managed paths are listed in $script:UpstreamManagedPaths.
    Consumer-owned paths (immune to upstream replay) are listed in
    $script:AlwaysLocalPaths; that list trumps the managed-paths list.

    State is tracked in .sdlc-ai-sync.json at the repo root (always-local,
    committed). Schema:

        { "remote": "sdlc.ai", "ref": "main",
          "lastSyncCommit": "<sha>", "syncedAt": "<iso8601-utc>" }

    A pre-flight guard refuses to run if any upstream-managed file shows
    local drift from the recorded anchor (catches policy violations before
    they get overwritten). Pass -Force to override.

.PARAMETER Branch
    Upstream branch to sync from. Default: main.

.PARAMETER RemoteName
    Local name for the upstream git remote. Default: sdlc.ai.

.PARAMETER RemoteUrl
    URL of the upstream IntelliSDLC.ai git remote. Default: the canonical
    IntelliTect-Samples copy. Override when running from a fork or mirror
    (e.g. an org-portable bootstrap that points at a same-org sibling).

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Print the planned op list and exit without modifying the working tree.

.PARAMETER Force
    Bypass the pre-flight drift guard. A warning banner is printed.

.PARAMETER Bootstrap
    Explicitly accept the empty-tree anchor (full refresh from upstream
    HEAD) without prompting. Usually unnecessary -- the script auto-detects
    an unambiguous bootstrap state (no .sdlc-ai-sync.json, no prior sync
    commit, AND no upstream-managed files present) and proceeds silently.
    Use this flag to force a full refresh even when managed files are
    already present (will overwrite them).

.PARAMETER NoPrompt
    Suppress the bootstrap prompt in ambiguous cases. Equivalent to
    -Bootstrap when no anchor is found; never prompts. Use in CI.

.PARAMETER NoAutoInit
    When the current directory is not a git repository, do NOT run
    `git init` automatically. Default behavior is to initialize the repo
    on the configured branch so the sync can proceed.

.PARAMETER CommitOnMain
    Commit the sync directly on the protected branch (typically `main`)
    instead of routing through the auto-worktree + PR path.

    Default is state-driven:
    * Bootstrap (no `.sdlc-ai-sync.json` AND no prior sync commit in the
      git log) -> on. The first sync of a repo is tooling onboarding,
      not a reviewable change; commit it directly.
    * Steady state (the consumer has been synced before) -> off. Route
      through the auto-worktree workflow so `main` stays clean and each
      sync is reviewed.

    Pass `-CommitOnMain` to force commit-on-main even in steady state
    (the rare "trusted maintenance commit" case). Pass
    `-CommitOnMain:$false` to force the auto-worktree path even at
    bootstrap.

.PARAMETER NoAutoWorktree
    When on the protected branch with a gate, do NOT auto-create a worktree.
    Restores the previous behavior: print remediation and exit rc=3.

.PARAMETER NoAutoPR
    During auto-worktree mode, commit + push but do NOT open a pull request.
    Useful in CI or when gh is misconfigured.

.PARAMETER NoSelfUpdate
    Skip the start-of-run self-refresh check that pulls the latest
    Pull-SDLC.ai.ps1 from upstream raw.githubusercontent.com. Also honored
    via the PULL_SDLC_NO_SELF_UPDATE environment variable. The re-exec path
    always passes this flag to prevent an infinite refresh loop.

.PARAMETER SetupGitHubSsh
    Run the GitHub-over-SSH-on-port-443 workstation setup and exit. Generates
    an ed25519 keypair, ensures the Windows ssh-agent service is running and
    set to Automatic startup, installs the three `url.insteadOf` rewrites that
    transparently route GitHub HTTPS clones through SSH on port 443 (works
    behind corporate firewalls that block port 22), sets `gh config
    git_protocol ssh`, and uploads the public key to GitHub via `gh ssh-key
    add`. Idempotent and safe to re-run; every step prints `[skip]` when
    already configured. Windows only -- issue #164.

.PARAMETER SkipKeyUpload
    With `-SetupGitHubSsh`, do NOT call `gh ssh-key add`. Useful when the key
    has already been registered out-of-band, or for unattended runs without
    `gh auth`. All other setup steps still run.

# --- Sync semantics --------------------------------------------------------
#
# The four script-level lists below ($script:TemplateScaffoldMap,
# $script:UpstreamManagedPaths, $script:AlwaysLocalPaths, $script:MergePaths)
# are the single canonical source of truth for what this script syncs and
# how. There is no separate manifest file -- everything the sync engine
# needs to know lives here.
#
# Path matching:
#   - Entries ending with '/' match any path under that directory prefix
#     (case-insensitive, ./ and .\ prefixes tolerated). All other entries
#     are exact filename matches against the repo-relative path.
#   - Paths are matched against the upstream tree via
#     `git diff --name-status -M -B <anchor> <ref> -- <paths>`.
#
# Precedence (high -> low):
#   1. $script:AlwaysLocalPaths -- consumer-owned. NEVER overwritten,
#      regardless of whether they also sit under a managed prefix.
#      Example: .github/instructions/project.instructions.md lives under
#      the managed .github/instructions/ tree but is filtered out of the
#      op list.
#   2. $script:MergePaths       -- union-merged. Upstream content is merged
#      INTO the consumer's copy so the consumer keeps any local entries
#      while gaining any new upstream ones. The .gitignore merge supports
#      an "upstream-only" marker block (lines between
#      '# >>> upstream-only >>>' and '# <<< upstream-only <<<',
#      case-insensitive) that Merge-FileFromUpstream strips before
#      propagation so entries in the block never reach consumers.
#   3. $script:UpstreamManagedPaths -- diff-replayed from upstream/<Branch>.
#      Local edits trigger the drift guard and abort the sync unless
#      -Force is passed.
#
# Template scaffolding:
#   $script:TemplateScaffoldMap maps <upstream template> -> <bare consumer
#   target>. Templates are scaffolded to the bare name only on first sync
#   (when the bare target does not yet exist); the bare name is
#   consumer-owned thereafter (it appears on $script:AlwaysLocalPaths).

# Map of <template path> -> <bare target path> used to scaffold consumer-owned
# files on first sync.

function ConvertTo-GitHubRepoSlug {

        Parses a git remote URL and returns the GitHub <owner>/<repo> slug.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Accepts the URL forms git remote get-url normally emits:
          https://github.com/Owner/Repo.git
          https://github.com/Owner/Repo

        Returns the canonical "Owner/Repo" string (no .git suffix). Returns
        $null for empty input or URLs that are not GitHub.

        Used to pass --repo explicitly to gh so it does not depend on
        `gh repo set-default`, which is unset on fresh consumer clones with
        multiple remotes (origin + sdlc.ai).

function Test-LsRemoteOutputHasExactBranch {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Returns $true iff the given `git ls-remote` output contains an exact
        match for refs/heads/<BranchName>.

    .DESCRIPTION
        `git ls-remote --heads <remote> <pattern>` matches <pattern> as a
        shell-style glob against the tail of each ref. That means passing
        a bare name like "main" can spuriously match "refs/heads/release/main"
        (or "refs/heads/main-old", depending on glob behavior across git
        versions), bypassing the missing-base-branch guard in
        Invoke-AutoWorktreeSync.

        Callers should pass `refs/heads/<BranchName>` to ls-remote (which
        avoids the tail glob entirely) AND verify the captured output via
        this helper so the check stays exact even if upstream git changes
        its globbing rules.

        Accepts the raw multi-line ls-remote output (string or string[]).
        Each ls-remote line is "<sha>\t<refname>". Trailing whitespace and
        empty lines are ignored.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Decides whether (and how) Invoke-AutoWorktreeSync should call gh to open the sync PR.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Pure decision helper extracted from Invoke-AutoWorktreeSync so the
        two failure modes that originally broke `gh pr create` on consumer
        repos are unit-testable without mocking git or gh:

          1. origin lacks the protected base branch entirely (first-time
             consumer clones that never `git push -u origin main`) ->
             return Action='Skip' with a remediation Reason.
          2. origin URL parses to a GitHub owner/repo slug -> return
             GhRepoArgs=@('--repo', '<slug>') so gh does not depend on
             `gh repo set-default` (often unset with two remotes).

    .SYNOPSIS
        Parses .gitignore text into ordered chunks. Each chunk is a contiguous
        run of comment lines (lines beginning with '#') followed by a
        contiguous run of entry lines (non-blank, non-comment). Blank lines
        and EOF terminate a chunk. A chunk may have only comments, only
        entries, or both -- but the comments always precede the entries.
    .OUTPUTS
        Array of hashtables: @{ Comments = [string[]]; Entries = [string[]] }.
        Order matches input order.

function Merge-FileFromUpstream {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Union-merges an upstream file's content into the consumer's copy.
        Today only supports .gitignore (chunked comment-block + entry
        semantics). Creates the local file if absent. Idempotent.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Reads the upstream file via `git show $Ref:$Path`. Parses both the
        upstream and the local copy into (comment-block + entry) chunks.
        For each upstream chunk: drops any entries already present in the
        local file; if no entries remain, drops the whole chunk. Surviving
        chunks are appended to the local file (or written as the new file
        if no local copy existed).

        Upstream-only marker blocks (lines between `# >>> upstream-only >>>`
        and `# <<< upstream-only <<<`, case-insensitive) are stripped from
        the upstream text before chunking, so entries inside the markers
        are never propagated to the consumer. An unterminated marker drops
        everything from the opener to end of file.

        Line endings are preserved -- if the local file uses CRLF, the
        appended content uses CRLF; otherwise LF.
    .OUTPUTS
        [bool] $true if the local file was modified (or created); $false
        when no changes were needed (already in sync).

        Restores a parent (typically `main`) working tree to a clean state

        the user dropped into the parent tree to bootstrap the script

        byte-identical to upstream the script either deletes it (untracked

        (tracked-but-modified case). When local content differs from

    .DESCRIPTION
        A fast blob-SHA comparison is used as a pre-filter. Because blob SHAs are
        end-of-line sensitive, a Windows consumer whose git committed the synced
        files with CRLF will have HEAD blobs that differ from the upstream LF
        blobs even though the content is identical. To avoid this false positive,
        any path whose blobs differ is confirmed with an EOL-insensitive content
        diff (git diff --ignore-cr-at-eol); only paths that still differ after
        ignoring CR-at-EOL are reported as drift. Genuine divergence -- including
        upstream-deleted files the consumer still has committed -- is preserved.

function Invoke-SelfRefresh {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Fetches the upstream Pull-SDLC.ai.ps1 and, if its SHA256 differs from
        the local copy, returns the path to a temp file containing the new
        content. The caller re-execs from that temp file; the on-disk
        $ScriptPath is intentionally NOT overwritten.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The fetch is cache-busted on every call (per-invocation query parameter
        plus Cache-Control / Pragma no-cache headers) to defeat Fastly stale
        hits on raw.githubusercontent.com -- otherwise a refresh issued within
        the CDN's TTL of a fresh upstream merge would silently no-op against
        the previous body.

        The on-disk script is left untouched (issue #180). Overwriting it on
        `main` produced a dirty working tree on every upstream change and
        silently destroyed any local edits. The upstream content is delivered
        to the consumer through the worktree sync's PR; when the user merges
        that PR and pulls, the on-disk script is updated through git like any
        other managed file.

        Every outcome is logged on the Verbose stream so '-Verbose' makes
        "did the refresh run, and what did it see?" answerable from the
        output without grepping for a missing line.
    .OUTPUTS
        [string] Absolute path to a temp file with the new upstream content,
        when an update is available (caller should re-exec from that path).
        Empty string when hashes match, the fetch failed, or any error

function Invoke-SelfRefreshGate {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Top-level self-refresh check for Pull-SDLC.ai.ps1. If an upstream
        update is available and successfully applied, re-execs the script
        with the supplied bound parameters and never returns.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Must be called from the script's top level (NOT from inside
        Invoke-PullSDLC). The `$BoundParameters` argument must be the
        script's outer `$PSBoundParameters` so every key is, by
        definition, bindable to the freshly-downloaded script on re-exec.

        See issue #110: invoking this from inside Invoke-PullSDLC caused
        function-only parameters such as `RemoteUrl` to leak into the
        splat, breaking re-exec on the outer script (which has no
        `RemoteUrl` parameter).
    .OUTPUTS
        [bool] $true if a re-exec was attempted (in production this path
        never returns; mocks may return synchronously). $false if no
        update was needed or the refresh failed.
